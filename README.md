# tn5250

Terminal emulator to connect to AS/400 session.

This program uses normal telnet protocol, not really 5250, so many features will lack.

This program is a lightweight (and fully open source) alternative to tn5250j.

This program is made up of a single shell script that properly configures
xterm and telnet for connection.
